🧪 exercise: error mapping with catch |err| switch
Why this exists (one-liner)

--> To translate low-level errors into higher-level meaning. (I've no clue what is meant by that 🤣)

What the exercise demonstrates

Errors are values

Errors are part of API boundaries

You control what leaks upward

Compiler forces you to handle every case
